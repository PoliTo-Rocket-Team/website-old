            <Position role="Web Developer" subteam="Operations" division="IT" code="OPS-ITC-001">
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>The role of the web developer is to manage the website in all its aspects, in order to present the team at the best. In particular, you will work with web technologies (SCSS, TypeScript, Svelte) to design, create, and mantain all the website sections, based on the team directives.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>A relatively big, possible future project could be the development of a backend that handles recruitment, renders pages based on information from (admin) lead engineers, and possibly receives and stores data collected during flights. </p>
                <h4>Required skills</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proficiency in CSS</li>

                <h3>How can I join the Team?</h3>
                <div class="response">
                    <p>The recruitment process has recently <em>closed</em>. The next recruitment will probably happen at the beginning of the next year: look out for any updates on our social medias and on our website.</p>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>Are there any requirements for joining the team?</h3>
                <div class="response"><p>Candidates must have <em>time to dedicate to our projects</em>, and an intermediate <em>English</em> proficiency level is preferred. We accept all PoliTo students regardless of program and year (undergraduate, graduate and PhD). Students are not required to have any prior experience or knowledge.</p></div>
            </article>
            <article class="question">
                <h3>Can I join as a <em>first-year</em> student?</h3>
                <div class="response">
                    <p>Yes, and we encourage you to! Theoretical knowledge and previous experience are appreciated, but they are not everything. Young and motivated students can learn and acquire real experience while working on our projects.</p>
                    <p>As of Fall 2022, more than half of the Team's members are Bachelor's students, and many of them are first-year students!</p>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>Can I join the team as an <em>international student</em>?</h3>
                <div class="response"><p>Of course! As of Fall 2022, more than 20% of the Team's members are international students. The selection process is the same for international and Italian students. As for any other student, good English knowledge is preferred. Italian language proficiency is not required, but appreciated.</p></div>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>Can I join the Team with a low level English proficiency?</h3>
                <div class="response"><p>The Team's official language is English, and it is preferred that candidates have at least an intermediate language proficiency. Candidates with advanced English proficiency will have an advantage. Exceptions can be made for candidates with a particular set of skills or with important prior experience.</p></div>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>How much <em>time</em> do I need to put into the team every week?</h3>
                <div class="response">
                    <p>There is not a rule for how much time you need to put in. There can be weeks where you will not work at all, but there will be days where you will need to work many hours. The Team is young and does not have a large number of members, so it is expected that the members of the Team put a considerable amount of work into our projects.</p>
                    <p>In general, we expect that students can provide <em>at the very least 6 hours</em> of work for the Team per week. Exceptions can be made for particular positions, such as those which require particular skills or prior experience.</p>     
                </div>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>Can I join the Team if I am <em>not</em> an engineering student?</h3>
                <div class="response"><p>Yes, the Team accepts students coming from <em>all programs</em> offered at Politecnico. There are many positions available in the Team, especially in the Operations subteam, which are suited also for students coming from non-engineering programs.</p></div>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>Do you recruit only aerospace engineering students?</h3>
                <div class="response">
                    <p>Of course not! Even if as of now the majority of the Team's members come from the aerospace engineering program (around 68% as of Fall 2022), some of the Team's positions are suited for students of the computer science, electronic, mechanical, management, or energy engineering programs, as well as many others.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, due to competition, the acceptance rate for aerospace engineering students is probably going to be lower than the one for students coming from other programs. This means that if you do not study aerospace engineering, you might face less competition in your application for certain positions than your aerospace engineering colleagues.</p>
                </div>
            </article>
            <article class="question">
                <h3>What is the <em>acceptance rate</em> onto the team?</h3>
                <div class="response"><p>Fall 2022 was the first general recruitment of the Team and we had an acceptance rate of around 15%. As much as we would love to accept every application, the Team can not manage the work of hundreds of members. Do not let this discourage you: we are always looking for motivated and talented young students.</p></div>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>Do you recruit at the beginning of the 2nd semester?</h3>
                <div class="response">
                    <p>We do not know yet, but <em>it is unlikely</em>. Training new members takes time, and if students join in the winter semester they will start working towards the end of the academic year, which is not ideal.</p>
                    <p>Students could be recruited at the beginning of the 2nd semester if they possess a particular set of skills or experience which matches the Team's needs.</p>

            <article class="question">
                <h3>Can I join the Team if I am <em>not</em> a Politecnico di Torino student, or if I am a high school student?</h3>
                <div class="response"><p>PoliTo Rocket Team is a student team which gets its resources from the Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace engineering of Politecnico di Torino. For this reason, we can't accept students outside Politecnico. However, it is possible to cooperate and work together on some particular projects. If are working on a rocketry-related project and you want to collaborate with us, contact us.</p></div>
