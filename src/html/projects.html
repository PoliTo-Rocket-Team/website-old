            <p>It's in the Team's goals to design and manufacture each year a new experimental rocket. In the 2022-2023 academic year, PoliTo Rocket Team has two active technical projects: Project Cavour and the Liquid Propulsion Project. Project Cavour stands for the design and creation of PRT's first rocket, while the Liquid Propulsion Project concerns the research and development of a liquid rocket engine. In the upcoming months, the Team aims to start new projects to upgrade and modernize its technological capabilities, such as thrust vector control and active-fin control.</p>

            <h2>Cavour</h2>

                <p>Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, was one of the leading figures of the Italian Unification and the main promoter of Italy’s industrial and scientific development. He was born in Turin in 1810, and died in Turin in 1861, being the first prime minister of Italy. PoliTo Rocket Team's first project is named after him.</p>
                <p>In accord with the Team's <a href="https://www.politorocketteam.it/about">Mission & Vision</a>, Cavour's design is simple and pragmatic, thought to draw the way for future projects. It is also the first rocket of the <em>Founding Fathers</em> series.</p>
                <p>Cavour is a single-stage, 2.25m long, solid propelled rocket, with a variable target altitude. It is composed of three compartments, the motor bay, which holds the COTS motor, the avionics bay, which includes the electronics and telemetry system, and the recovery bay, which contains the parachutes and other recovery components. The airframe has an internal diameter of 100mm and makes large use of 3D printed and composite materials.</p>
                <p>Cavour has completed its preliminary design phase. Its mission objectives are the validation of flight simulations and the testing of the rocket's systems. In the future, the Cavour Project will evolve towards a reusable rocket with payload capacity, capable of conducting scientific experiments inexpensively and reliably at a precise predetermined apogee.</p>

                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                <!-- <p>Made from both COTS and in-house parts, Cavour is designed to be:</p> -->
                <ol>
                    <li>Cost-effective and durable: It is the first rocket of the Team, and it must be proven that with the least possible budget the group is capable of designing and manufacturing a durable rocket which can sustain a high-powered flight while fulfilling the mission objectives;</li>
                    <li>Reconfigurable: The Cavour Rocket structure design is modular, able to mount different motors, of different classes, different lengths (ranging from around 300mm to 700mm) and different diameters. It will be possible to launch the rocket with COTS motors of 38mm, 54mm and 75mm diameters. It could be possible to perform a 98mm permanent motor integration. Multiple versions of the rocket can be launched with different mission objectives, such as different apogee targets, payload launch and deployment, or system testing;</li>
                    <li>Reusable: The rocket is designed to safely descend with the drogue chute, after reaching the apogee, with a planned velocity of around 27 m/s, and to deploy the main parachute at the designated altitude. It is planned to land with a velocity of approximately 5.5 m/s without inflicting any damage to its airframe or to the environment, so that the rocket is capable of being flown again without any major repair after just some refueling. By being a fully reusable rocket, it is capable of performing multiple launches without developing major structural damage, managing to be cheaper to operate and maintain, while maintaining the capability of a high-powered flight.</li>

            <h2>Liquid Propulsion Engine</h2>
            <div class="two-cols">
                <h3>Context: New space economy</h3>
                <p>The potential of space 4.0 exploration for Italy, Europe and the world is enormous. Europe and the world are facing major global challenges which require equally global responses and imply responsibilities. According with ESA definitions, Space 4.0 era is a time when space is evolving from being the preserve of the governments of a few Spacefaring nations to a situation in which there is the increased number of diverse space actors around the world, including the emergence of private companies, participation with academia, industry and citizens, digitisation, and global interaction.</p>
                <h3>Objective: Improve the Italian heritage on liquid rocket engine</h3>
                <p>The liquid propulsion project aims to contribute on a strategic, dynamic, and innovative way to the new space economy, playing a role in the European mission: to shape the development of Italian’s space capability and ensure that investment in space continues to deliver benefits to the citizens of Europe.</p>
                <p>Liquid propulsion is a new concept for Italy, started thanks to AVIO spa M10 development. In order to provide support to the Italian Liquid Rocket Engine community, the Polito RocketTeam Liquid Propulsion Project is developing the first Italian pressure fed LOX Methane Liquid Rocket Engine.</p>
                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reusability: Liquid Rocket Engine are known as one mission engine. Nowadays, in order to reduce space pollution and cost par Kg to orbit, important industries are focusing on reusability of first rocket stages. To persuade this goal liquid propulsion is one of the key factors. Politecnico di Torino Rocket Team have chosen to full develop a liquid regenerative rocket engine in order to propose a small and reusable propulsion system for first stages of general micro launcher;</li>
                    <li>New Materials: Thrust chamber of high performance bi-propellant liquid rocket engines is a critical component of the launch vehicles because it is designed to operate in some of the most severe conditions seen in engineering practice. The requirement of reducing the temperature of the walls exposed to the hot gas can be met with high-thermal conductivity copper alloys while the mechanical stiffness is achieved by using high strength steel or nickel alloys. Because the stress–strain behaviour of a regeneratively cooled thrust chamber is directly correlated with its temperature behaviour, it is of primary importance to select the correct alloy. Thanks to Politecnico R&D partnership the new Liquid Rocket Engine will de design with some of must recent Copper based Metal Matrix Composite materials;</li>
                    <li>New technologies: Nowadays manufacturing processes are playing an important role in the global space industry, with particular emphasis respect to space propulsion. The Liquid Propulsion project aims to produce the whole engine assemble via additive manufacturing. Thanks to this process new geometries and potential mass optimization can be investigate leading to potential new design opportunities, cost reduction and technological progresses;</li>
                    <li>Static fire qualification program: The Liquid Rocket Engine under development has been design in order to be tested with a new test bench facility. Qualification and integration will be performed to mech mission requirement and targets;</li>
                    <li>Simplicity: The regenerative pressure fed engine cycle is able to provide great result with simplest design efforts respect to more complex engine cycle such as E-pomp or open engine cycles;</li>
                    <li>Green: LOX/bio-CH4 is the optimum compromise for power requirements, environment care and modern trend;</li>
