                            <p>The role of the web developer is to manage the website in all its aspects, in order to present the team at its best.</p>
                            <p>In particular, you will work with web technologies (such as SCSS and TypeScript, and maybe in the future Svelte and the Actix framework) to design, create, and maintain all the website sections, based on the team directives.</p>
                            <p>Examples of practical works to do in the near future are: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Expanding the homepage and its interactivity</li>
                                <li>working with 3D models to enhance user experience</li>
                                <li>design and create unique description/presentation pages for each rocket</li>
                                <li>design and create a section about the division of the team </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A relatively big, possible future project could be the development of a backend that handles recruitment, renders pages based on information from (admin) lead engineers, and possibly receives and stores data collected during flights.</p>

                    <h3>How can I join the Team?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>The recruitment process has <em>not</em> started yet.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the Fall semester, we will publish on our socials and on our website all the info regarding the application process. An <em>Info Session</em> is planned for the beginning of the semester to present the Team's projects and answer students' questions. You can expect that, in the application process, we will need your CV or resume, an optional motivational letter, and some info about you.</p>

                    <h3>Are there any requirements for joining the team?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>Candidates must have <em>time to dedicate to our projects</em>, and at least an intermediate <em>English</em> proficiency level. We accept all PoliTo students regardless of program and year (undergraduate, graduate and PhD). Students are not required to have any prior experience or knowledge. </p>

                        <p>Yes, and we encourage you to! Theoretical knowledge and previous experience are appreciated, but they are not everything. Young and motivated students can learn and acquire real experience while working on our projects.</p>

                    <h3>Can I join the team as an <em>international student</em>?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>Of course! As of the summer of 2022, around 10% of the Team's members are international students. The selection process is the same for international and Italian students. As for any other student, good English knowledge is preferred. Italian language proficiency is not required, but appreciated.</p>

                    <h3>Can I join the Team with a low level English proficiency?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>The Team's official language is English, and it is required that candidates have at least an intermediate language proficiency. Candidates with advanced English proficiency will have an advantage. Exceptions can be made for candidates with a particular set of skills or with important prior experience.</p>

                    <h3>How much <em>time</em> do I need to put into the team every week?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>There is not a rule for how much time you need to put in. The Team is young and does not have a large number of members, so it is expected that the members of the Team put a considerable amount of work into our projects.</p>
                        <p>In general, we expect that students can provide <em>at the very least 5 hours</em> of work for the Team per week. Exceptions can be made for particular positions, such as those which require particular skills or prior experience.</p>

                    <h3>Can I join the Team if I am <em>not</em> an engineering student?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>Yes, the Team accepts students coming from <em>all programs</em> offered at Politecnico. There are many positions available in the Team, especially in the Logistics subteam, which are suited also for students coming from non-engineering programs.</p>

                    <h3>Do you recruit only aerospace engineering students?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>Of course not! Even if as of now the majority of the Team's members come from the aerospace engineering program (around 70% as of summer 2022), some of the Team's positions are suited for students of the computer science, electronic, mechanical, management, or energy engineering programs, as well as many others.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the acceptance rate for aerospace engineering students is probably going to be lower than the one for students coming from other programs, so if you do not study aerospace engineering, you are possibly going to have an advantage in your application compared to your aerospace eng. colleagues.</p>

                    <h3>What is the <em>acceptance rate</em> onto the team?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>We don’t know yet! Fall 2022 will be the first general recruitment of the Team. We hope to accept every application, however the Team does not plan an extensive expansion of its members, which would be impossible to manage.</p>

                    <h3>Do you recruit at the beginning of the 2nd semester?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>We do not know yet, but <em>it is unlikely</em>. Training new members takes time, and if students join in the winter semester they will start working towards the end of the academic year, which is not ideal.</p>
                        <p>Students could be recruited at the beginning of the 2nd semester if they possess a particular set of skills or experience which matches the Team's needs.</p>

                    <h3>Can I join the Team if I am <em>not</em> a Politecnico di Torino student, or if I am a high school student?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>PoliTo Rocket Team is a student team which gets its resources from the Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace engineering of Politecnico di Torino. For this reason, we can't accept students outside Politecnico. However, it is possible to cooperate and work together on some particular projects. If are working on a rocketry-related project and you want to collaborate with us, contact us.</p>
