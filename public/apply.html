                            <p>The Safety & Launch Manager is one of the most important positions of the Team.</p>
                            <p>The manager(s) will need to organise the Teamâ€™s launches, hence it is needed to acquire an understanding of International Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) Range Standard Operating Procedures, of the design regulations for competition rockets, and of general rocket safety (ex. by reading the NASA guidelines or ISO standards), and provide these to the Teamâ€™s subteams and divisions in a useful format.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the manager(s) will be in charge of the Teamâ€™s safety procedures for the Teamâ€™s launches, when external safety experts are not present. The manager(s) will supervise the rocket assembly with the Teamâ€™s leads, and take responsibility for the launch safety procedures, this includes writing risk assessment and risk analysis tables on the Teamâ€™s reports.</p>
                            <p>The manager(s) will organize and hold internal safety reviews for major events and projects, and engage with external experts and organisers from the competitions.</p>
                            <p>The manager(s) will also ensure safety of dangerous chemical storage and logistics, in close collaboration with the Logistics Manager(s).</p>
                            <p>Please be informed that your work will be entirely voluntary. As we are a student team of Politecnico di Torino, we do not offer any paid employment.</p>

                            <p>Wireless communication plays a fundamental role before, during and after the flight: it allows the ground station to monitor the system status and evaluate possible risks, it transmits data real time in order to know exactly the rocketâ€™s altitude, speed and all other useful parameters, and finally it allows an easier recovery process by communicating the rocket GPS location. Due to its extreme importance, our team needs a specialized figure able to design, simulate and develop the communication system between the rocket and the ground station at physical level. The job will consist of lots of research, investigation on technologies and protocols, positioning and directioning for the ground and on-board antennas in order to optimize data transmission.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of the Fall semester, we will publish on our socials and on our website all the info regarding the application process. An <em>Info Session</em> is planned for the beginning of the semester to present the Team's projects and answer students' questions. You can expect that, in the application process, we will need your CV or resume, and some info about you.</p>

                    <div class="response"><p>Of course! As of the summer of 2022, around 10% of the Team's members are international students. The selection process is the same for international and Italian students. As for any other student, good English knowledge is preferred. Italian language proficiency is not required, but appreciated.</p></div>

                    <div class="response">
                        <p>There is not a rule for how much time you need to put in. There can be weeks where you will not work at all, but there will be days where you will need to work many hours. The Team is young and does not have a large number of members, so it is expected that the members of the Team put a considerable amount of work into our projects.</p>
                        <p>In general, we expect that students can provide <em>at the very least 5 hours</em> of work for the Team per week. Exceptions can be made for particular positions, such as those which require particular skills or prior experience.</p>

                    <div class="response"><p>Yes, the Team accepts students coming from <em>all programs</em> offered at Politecnico. There are many positions available in the Team, especially in the Logistics subteam, which are suited also for students coming from non-engineering programs.</p></div>

                    <h3>Do you recruit only aerospace engineering students?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>Of course not! Even if as of now the majority of the Team's members come from the aerospace engineering program (around 70% as of summer 2022), some of the Team's positions are suited for students of the computer science, electronic, mechanical, management, or energy engineering programs, as well as many others.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, due to competition, the acceptance rate for aerospace engineering students is probably going to be lower than the one for students coming from other programs. This means that if you do not study aerospace engineering, you might face less competition in your application for certain positions than your aerospace engineering colleagues.</p>

                    <h3>Do you recruit at the beginning of the 2nd semester?</h3>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>We do not know yet, but <em>it is unlikely</em>. Training new members takes time, and if students join in the winter semester they will start working towards the end of the academic year, which is not ideal.</p>
                        <p>Students could be recruited at the beginning of the 2nd semester if they possess a particular set of skills or experience which matches the Team's needs.</p>

                    <h3>Can I join the Team if I am <em>not</em> a Politecnico di Torino student, or if I am a high school student?</h3>
                    <div class="response"><p>PoliTo Rocket Team is a student team which gets its resources from the Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace engineering of Politecnico di Torino. For this reason, we can't accept students outside Politecnico. However, it is possible to cooperate and work together on some particular projects. If are working on a rocketry-related project and you want to collaborate with us, contact us.</p></div>
